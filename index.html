I’m an engineering student, writer, and aspiring startup founder. I’m passionate about solving real-life problems through technology and creativity, and I dream of building a life where my family lives stress-free while I take charge. Alongside my technical journey, I also write stories because I believe words can create change just as much as innovation can.</p> <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-sm-flex justify-content-sm-center">  </div> </div> </div>

            <div class="px-4 py-5 my-5 text-center"> <img class="d-block mx-auto mb-4" src="./work.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="200px" style="border-radius: 50%;"> <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">My skills</h1> <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto"> <p class="lead mb-4">I’m someone who dives headfirst into what I’m passionate about, whether it’s coding, writing, or building something from scratch. I have this ability to understand complex concepts quickly—like algorithms, programming languages, or microcontrollers—and then actually turn them into something functional. I don’t just learn; I apply.

I’m creative, not just in writing stories that touch people, but also in solving real-world problems with my projects and startup ideas. I notice gaps that others might overlook and I find ways to fill them efficiently. I have a keen eye for detail, whether it’s in a story plot, a piece of code, or even how I present myself in a professional or personal project.

I’m resilient and determined. Challenges don’t intimidate me—I face them, analyze, and overcome. I don’t shy away from standing up for myself or others, whether it’s in college, in a project team, or in life.

I’m also self-aware and growth-oriented. I know my strengths and I keep honing them, while also recognizing areas I need to improve. I like to balance technical skills with emotional intelligence—I care about people and relationships as much as I care about success.

Lastly, I’m vision-driven. I don’t just want to do things; I want to create impact. I aim for financial independence, personal growth, and leaving a mark through my work—be it in tech, writing, or my startup ventures.</p> <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-sm-flex justify-content-sm-center">  </div> </div> </div>

Whether it’s building an ATM management system in C, or experimenting with Arduino circuits, I take a hands-on approach. I love turning ideas into functional solutions, combining coding and smart design.

I also work on startup-level projects, like building SnapShop app to connect customers with local stores or designing a career guidance AI system, where I manage everything from ideation to execution. These projects show my ability to think strategically, plan thoroughly, and collaborate effectively, even when the work is complex.

Beyond technical projects, I pour myself into creative ventures like writing stories for Kindle Direct Publishing and designing digital products, showing that I can blend logic with creativity. Each project is a reflection of my curiosity, determination, and drive to make an impact, whether in tech, entrepreneurship, or storytelling. 

My work 'This is how our story began' is receiving lots of love on WebNovel. This shows my versatality in different fields. Be it technology or literature, I'm a prominent figure in both fields.</p> <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-sm-flex justify-content-sm-center">  </div> </div> </div>
